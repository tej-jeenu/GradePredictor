# Grade Predictors

The **Grade Predictor** is a machine learning-based application designed to predict student grades based on various input features such as study hours, attendance, and previous exam scores. This project is built using Python and leverages popular libraries like Scikit-learn, Pandas, and NumPy for data processing and model training.

## Features

- **Data Preprocessing**: Cleans and prepares the dataset for training.
- **Model Training**: Utilizes machine learning algorithms to predict grades.
- **User-Friendly Interface**: Simple and intuitive interface for inputting data and viewing predictions.
- **Customizable**: Easily extendable to include additional features or datasets.

## Installation

To get started with the Grade Predictor, follow these steps:

1. **Clone the Repository**:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/tej-jeenu/GradePredictor.git
   cd GradePredictor
   ```

2. **Install Dependencies**:
   Ensure you have Python 3.x installed. Then, install the required packages using pip:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

3. **Run the Application**:
   Execute the main script to start the Grade Predictor:
   ```bash
   python main.py
   ```

## Usage

1. **Input Data**: Enter the required details such as study hours, attendance percentage, and previous exam scores.
2. **Predict Grade**: Click the "Predict" button to get the predicted grade.
3. **View Results**: The predicted grade will be displayed on the screen.

## Dataset

The dataset used for training the model is included in the `data/` directory. It contains historical data on student performance, which is used to train the machine learning model.

## Model

The current version of the Grade Predictor uses a **Linear Regression** model. However, the code is designed to be modular, allowing you to experiment with other algorithms such as Decision Trees, Random Forests, or Neural Networks.
